    		<p>This week's website is a storefront page featuring a new line of Bose headphones. As far as I can tell the page is only available in french, which is okay, because I speak french. Otherwise it might have posed a bit of a language barrier. That being said, if I were still able to navigate the page easily despite not being able to speak french, it would be an attestment to the intuitive navigation and show that the site's layout is universally navigable.<br><br>

          I initially was interested in the site because of its 100% tall strips of image/color that, when hovered over, widened to show more information about the product. It's similar to what I had in mind for my first project, when redesigning the Towson Art Gallery's website. I wanted to include that kind of responsiveness in my site design and really like how the Bose website incorporated that into their page.
