		<h2>Week 3 website</h2>
		<div class="container3">
		<img class="thumb" src="images/michele.png" alt="Michele Mazzucco thumbnail">
		<h3><a id="michelelink" href="http://michelemazzucco.it/">Michele Mazzucco</a></h3><br><br>
		<p id="michele">For the third week's favorite website I chose designer Michele Mazzucco's website. Her website is primarily used as a portfolio and contact page to get in touch with her for design work. Initially I wasn't too drawn to her website because I felt that its color scheme and lack of header image made it too plain to be worth scrolling down, but upon a second inspection I found that I actually enjoyed a few of the elements on the site.<br><br>

			As I did with my previously chosen sites, I like the use of the 100% height content dividers, navigable by the anchored links across the top menu bar. I like the way she laid out her about me section and her contact sheet in the double column layout. Especially in the about me section, with the left side being occupied by a large image that fits in well with the flat color scheme and doesn't command too much attention.

		<h2>Week 2 website</h2>
	<div class="container2">
		<img class="thumb" src="images/gravity.png" alt="Gravity Supernova thumbnail">
		<h3><a id="gravlink" href="http://thegravity.net/supernova/">Supernova</a></h3><br><br>
		<p id="gravity">This week, I chose the website theme "<i>Supernova</i>" produced by The Gravity, a small design studio. This particular page is actually a wordpress theme that they created for users to install on their own websites.<br><br>

		I was first drawn to the site by its bold and contrasting colors: I find that I'm immediately interested in sites with color schemes that pop. Upon loading the page I discovered a lot of features and elements that I enjoyed: the first page is split into different content sections that the user accesses by scrolling, and, much like my website choice from last week, the sections are visually divided by different background colors and a change of style.<br><br>

	As you scroll, the partially-transparent header bar becomes condensed into a thinner bar to take up less vertical screen space. At the top of the homepage, there's also a widget that scrolls between a few different 'screens' and cycles the text and background image depending on which screen is selected. The user is also given < and > buttons to be able to control which screen display they see.

		<h2>Week 1 website</h2>
	<div class="container">
		<img class="thumb" src="images/tiescreen.png" alt="This is Electric thumbnail">
		<h3><a href="http://www.electricmainline.co.uk/">Electric Mainline</a></h3><br><br>
		<p>For this first homework assignment, I chose the website "<i>Electric Mainline</i>." Electric Mainline serves as Creative Art Director Leigh Whipday's online portfolio of his works and projects.<br><br>

		What I liked about his website was the sectioned/split layout created with the change of background color for each different section. I've seen this style used on other websites before and I really like the way it divides content. I also love the use of anchored links for easy page-navigation and think those two different features work well together.</p>
