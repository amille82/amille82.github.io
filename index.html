		<p>For this first homework assignment, I chose the website "<i>Electric Mainline</i>." Electric Mainline serves as Creative Art Director Leigh Whipday's online portfolio of his works and projects.<br><br>

		What I liked about his website was the sectioned/split layout created with the change of background color for each different section. I've seen this style used on other websites before and I really like the way it divides content. I also love the use of anchored links for easy page-navigation and think those two different features work well together.</p>
